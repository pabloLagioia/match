Match Service
=============

This service is used to serve Matchjs files.

You need place this code at the same directory level as match-internal. This service will concatenate all Matchjs sources and serve them, this way you can have just one script src="http//localhost:8086/match/merged" in your index and still work on fixing or adding features to Matchjs.
